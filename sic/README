NOTE: The *.diff patches are already applied to sic.c (and config.def.h where applicable) and are ONLY included for code reference, when comparing this to https://git.suckless.org/sic

Also changed command (input) character from default : to / to be more in line with (all) other IRC clients.

sic - simple irc client
=======================
sic is an extremely fast, small and simple irc client.  It reads commands from
standard input and prints all server output to standard output. It multiplexes
also all channel traffic into one output so that you don't have to switch
different channel buffers: that's actually a feature.


Installation
------------
Edit the Makefile or override the flags to match your local setup. sic is
installed into /usr/local by default.

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install sic 
(if necessary as root):

	$ make
	# make install


Running sic
-----------
Simply invoke the 'sic' command with the required arguments.
